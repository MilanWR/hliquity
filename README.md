# hliquity

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK - I created this script for my own use, and I am happy to share it with others. However, if you do not feel comfortable with executing this script you should definitely not do it. Only use it if you know what you're doing.

The script unstakeLp.js is for those who would like to withdraw their LP tokens from Hliquity (hliquity.org), while they are resolving their UI issue with the frontend (dissapearing unstake button).

## Instructions
1. `npm install`
2. Fill in your accountId, private key and the amount you want to execute.
2. Run the script: `node unstakeLp.js`
